In Matlab, Mosek is used via the matlab mosek toolbox available for download at http://mosek.com
To install on linux 64bit, execute these commands:

In the directory opt_interface/mosek : 

For Mosek v6:
        wget http://www.mosek.com/fileadmin/download/stable/6/mosektoolslinux64x86.tar.gz
        tar xzf mosektoolslinux64x86.tar.gz

In Octave, Mosek is used via a wrapper located in the directory 
        '...../opt_interface/mosek/mosek_interface/'
The wrapper should be compiled before it can be used. For that, ensure 
that the mosek toolbox is downloaded and placed as described above. 
Also ensure that the Makefile in the mosek_interface directory uses 
the appropriate 'mkoctfile' binary of Octave.
Then execute 'make' to compile it.

Set the paths to mosek libraries in opt_license.m
Ensure that the $MOSEKLM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable points to the MOSEK license on your system.

Ensure that you include 
        1. (...)/opt_interface/mosek/mosek/6/tools/platform/linux64x86/bin
        2. (...)/opt_interface/mosek/mosek/6/toolbox/r2007a
in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. Adjust the second, if needed.
