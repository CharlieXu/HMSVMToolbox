This directory contains a simple matlab interface to the CPLEX
optimization software.

See http://www.ilog.com/products/cplex/

For installation, the file cplex_license.m has to be modfied such that
the entries of the opt_envstr cell point to the correct license manager(s).

Once these are adjusted, run the compile_mex.sh script to create mex
files. Now, train_hmsvm.m should be able to use the CPLEX solver.
